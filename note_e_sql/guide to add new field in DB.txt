Add new field in jsonobject or use the field already present in json object.
    If need add new field in json object you should insert in feedbackplugin HO! side

All steps in local php enviromnent, after, push on git and upload update files and db updates in remote server

Add new field in DB in the correct table (using phpmyadmin):
    ALTER TABLE `yii2_ho_feedback_player` ADD `injury_status` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' AFTER `stamina`;

Connect to http://hoserver.loc:8080/gii/model
and regenerate the specific, in this case: models/base/HoFeedbackBase.php
see the screenshot model_update.png, and fill field as see
press 'preview'
and check diff, generally we should see only some line in particular relaed to to directive 'use' and new fiels added., in this example
	use app\models\User;
use app\models\HoFeedback;
use app\models\HoFeedbackPosition;
copy these line and generate/overwrite
open the file by ide and paste the difference on directive use.
and new fiels added.

Open the model models/HoFeedback.php that cointains the logic:
and add the line to read a new value in correct section, in this case:
       $player->injury_status = $p["m_iVerletzt"];
at this moment you can check (by some tests) if the field is correct saved in db

update the result view:
update the file commands/UtilHoFeedbackController.php inserting the new field added
open terminal in hoserver folder and run this command:
php yii util-ho-feedback/create-sql-ho-result-view
now open the script created and execute the script in db.

Connect to http://hoserver.loc:8080/gii/model
and update the base/HoFeedbackResultViewBase.php
as do before check the difference and copy the code will be in new file (you can use the compare function in ide)

update the front end views:
http://hoserver.loc:8080/gii/crud
and update the app\models\HoFeedbackResultView
overwrite only these files:
views/ho-feedback-result-view/index.php
views/ho-feedback-result-view/view.php
and check the difference and restore the code deleted
first view.php and then index.php
